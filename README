# Thoughts

* On first use _from should get a verification email, nothing happens until
  an email account is verified. For now, just allow
* 


# Example

* http://service.localhost/query2form/?_from=jon@rejon.org&_reply_to=wanglizhong@rejon.org&_subject=Sign Contributor Licensing Agreement&_cc=team@rejon.org&_success=You Successfully Signed the Form!&_body=This is the signing process for the Contributor license Agreement&_file=http://so.me/file.pdf&fullname=text&title=text&company=text&email=@_replyto@&address=text&sign-with-your-initials=text&_submit=Sign&_action=http://service.localhost/query2update

** query2update can probably just have both
** query2email should work interchangeably, just query2update should work
   as emailing both parties, and query2update really should be something like:

   http://service.localhost/query2update/some-list

   And that some-list can just be a folder with a csv file in it listing out
   some updates, and then when query2update gets hit with that some-list
   and other query data, push one more update to the list, like a cheap
   listing of items...
